## Requirements
* numpy
* matplotlib
* tqdm

## Experiments

### Primes
* Lists primes starting at 1100000 where 'v divides p-1' for v in (2, ,3 , 4, 5, 6 ... )
* Passing 'use_v_is_g' as 'True' will force to list only primes where v is also a generator of the group of order p.
* Remark that v is never a generator when v in (4, 5, 8)
